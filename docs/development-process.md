# Rancher2 Provider

Terraform has recently evolved into a spotlight infrastructure provisioning tool that is maintained by Rancher engineering. As its popularity grows, so will its open source development.

Improvements to note since Jan 2023
* Rancher2 Provider docs
* Branching into `master 3.x.x` for Rancher 2.7 clusters and `release/v2 2.x.x` for Rancher 2.6 clusters
* Scripts to test Terraform RCs locally on unix and windows

### Development Process

If you are an open source contributor,

1. Add a feature / bug fix and smoke test it
2. Add or update tests
3. Open a PR! Add detailed test steps to **Testing** on the [PR template](.github/pull_request_template.md) so Terraform maintainers know how to test your solution.
4. Get 2 PR reviews (at least 1 from a Terraform maintainer)
5. Merge your PR (a Terraform maintainer will do this if you do not have repo access)
